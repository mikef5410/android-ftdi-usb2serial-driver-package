Different Targets can be built by implementing a _init_func() and _main_func()_
function in src/main_foo.c

The resulting binary main_foo.bin can be built by issuing
	make BOARD=PCD TARGET=main_foo

If you want to add debugging support (debug unit aka DBGU, RS232), add DEBUG=1


Building dfu.bin (the DFU loader binary):
	make -f Makefile.dfu BOARD=PCD
